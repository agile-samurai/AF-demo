Barkawi knows Asher is still alive, and promises that if Kamran captures him, he will broadcast the execution of the President on the Internet. Trumbull orders his intelligence staff to locate Barkawi&#39;s known operatives to find any connection to the attack, while British authorities have all first responders stand down, so that any left in the open can be identified as terrorists.After leaving a sign to be picked up by satellite tracking, Banning leads Asher to an <a href="null" class="new" title="Secret Intelligence Service (page does not exist)">MI6</a> safe-house, where Jacquelin &quot;Jax&quot; Marshall (<a href="null" class="new" title="Charlotte Riley (page does not exist)">Charlotte Riley</a>) briefs them on what their intelligence has learned.

They also suspect that there is a mole in the British government.Trumbull&#39;s staff have identified a building in London owned by one of Barkawi&#39;s companies, which still appears to be drawing massive amounts of power despite supposedly being under construction and unoccupied, and suspect it is Kamran&#39;s headquarters. Banning joins the extraction team to infiltrate the building and stop Kamran before he can kill Asher.Banning and Asher escape just before the building is destroyed by the Delta Force/SAS squad, killing Kamran and the remaining terrorists.

He sits in front of his laptop and contemplates sending his letter of resignation. On TV, Trumbull speaks regarding the recent events, leaving an inspiring message that the U.S. will prevail. This convinces Banning to delete the letter.==Cast==* <a href="null" class="new" title="Gerard Butler (page does not exist)">Gerard Butler</a> as <a href="null" class="new" title="United States Secret Service (page does not exist)">Secret Service</a> Agent Mike Banning* <a href="null" class="new" title="Aaron Eckhart (page does not exist)">Aaron Eckhart</a> as <a href="null" class="new" title="President of the United States (page does not exist)">US President</a> Benjamin Asher* <a href="null" class="new" title="Morgan Freeman (page does not exist)">Morgan Freeman</a> as <a href="null" class="new" title="Vice President of the United States (page does not exist)">US Vice President</a> Allan Trumbull* <a href="null" class="new" title="Alon Aboutboul (page does not exist)">Alon Aboutboul</a> as Aamir Barkawi, an arms dealer and terrorist mastermind who is No. 6 on the <a href="null" class="new" title="FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives (page does not exist)">FBI&#39;s 10 Most Wanted</a> list.* <a href="null" class="new" title="Angela Bassett (page does not exist)">Angela Bassett</a> as <a href="null" class="new" title="Director of the United States Secret Service (page does not exist)">Secret Service Director</a> Lynne Jacobs* <a href="null" class="new" title="Robert Forster (page does not exist)">Robert Forster</a> as <a href="null" class="new" title="United States Army (page does not exist)">US Army</a> <a href="null" class="new" title="General (United States) (page does not exist)">General</a> Edward Clegg, <a href="null" class="new" title="Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (page does not exist)">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>.* <a href="null" class="new" title="Jackie Earle Haley (page does not exist)">Jackie Earle Haley</a> as <a href="null" class="new" title="White House Deputy Chief of Staff (page does not exist)">White House Deputy Chief of Staff</a> DC Mason* <a href="null" class="new" title="Melissa Leo (page does not exist)">Melissa Leo</a> as <a href="null" class="new" title="United States Secretary of Defense (page does not exist)">Secretary of Defense</a> Ruth McMillan* <a href="null" class="new" title="Radha Mitchell (page does not exist)">Radha Mitchell</a> as Leah Banning, Mike&#39;s wife.* <a href="null" class="new" title="Sean O'Bryan (page does not exist)">Sean O&#39;Bryan</a> as <a href="null" class="new" title="Deputy Director of the National Security Agency (page does not exist)">NSA Deputy Director</a> Ray Monroe* <a href="null" class="new" title="Charlotte Riley (page does not exist)">Charlotte Riley</a> as <a href="null" class="new" title="Secret Intelligence Service (page does not exist)">MI6</a> Agent Jacquelin &quot;Jax&quot;
